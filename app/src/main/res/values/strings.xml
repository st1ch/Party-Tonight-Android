    <string name="terms_and_conditions_intro">
        &#160;Please read these Terms and Conditions ("Terms", "Terms and Conditions") carefully before using
        the www.executivemmethods.com website and the Go party
        tonight mobile application (together, or individually, the "Service")
        operated by Executivemmethods Inc ("us", "we", or "our").
        Your access to and use of the Service is conditioned upon your
        acceptance of and compliance with these Terms. These Terms
        apply to all visitors, users and others who wish to access or use
        the Service.
        By accessing or using the Service you agree to be bound by these
        Terms. If you disagree with any part of the terms then you do not
        have permission to access the Service.
    </string>

    <string name="terms_and_conditions_subscriptions">
        &#160;Some parts of the Service are billed on a subscription basis ("Subscription(s)"). You will be billed in advance on a recurring and
        periodic basis ("Billing Cycle"). Billing cycles are set on a monthly
        basis.
        At the end of each Billing Cycle, your Subscription will
        automatically renew under the exact same conditions unless you
        cancel it or Executivemmethods Inc cancels it. You may cancel
        your Subscription renewal either through your online account
        management page or by contacting Executivemmethods Inc
        customer support team.
        A valid payment method, including credit card or PayPal, is
        required to process the payment for your Subscription. You shall
        provide Executivemmethods Inc with accurate and complete billing information including full name, address, state, zip code, telephone
        number, and a valid payment method information. By submitting
        such payment information, you automatically authorize
        Executivemmethods Inc to charge all Subscription fees incurred
        through your account to any such payment instruments.
        Should automatic billing fail to occur for any reason,
        Executivemmethods Inc will issue an electronic invoice indicating
        that you must proceed manually, within a certain deadline date,
        with the full payment corresponding to the billing period as
        indicated on the invoice.

    <string name="terms_and_conditions_fee">

        Subscription fee change will become effective at the end of the
        then-current Billing Cycle.
        Executivemmethods Inc will provide you with a reasonable prior
        notice of any change in Subscription fees to give you an
        opportunity to terminate your Subscription before such change
        becomes effective.
        Your continued use of the Service after the Subscription fee
        change comes into effect constitutes your agreement to pay the
        modified Subscription fee amount.
